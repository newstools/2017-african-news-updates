The South African government has announced new plans to make sex workers pay taxes.According to a report released by SARS this week, the South African government loses billions of Rands per year because sex workers are not entitled to pay taxes.The government is however planning to change this by implementing new ways of tracking how much money sex workers make per annum.&#8220;We are going to make sex workers and strippers use swiping machines for tracking purposes, and also encourage them to submit financial reports every year so we can know they are not robbing the government. This will help boost the economy of our country&#8221;. said a representative of the South African Revenue Services.According sources, regular customers won&#8217;t have to swipe or pay cash, money will be debited from their accounts on a monthly basis.This system is expected to be live by March 2017.
