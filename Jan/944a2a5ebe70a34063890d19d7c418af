Just a day after the release of matric results in South Africa, King Mswati III, who is famously known for his controversial bride selection has decided to honour South African President Jacob Zuma with a beautiful gift. Mswati usually selects a wife during the Reed Dance ceremony, known as Umhlanga which reveals thousands of Swaziland s prettiest virgins dancing topless for King Mswati III, every year.The king decided this time that he will not wait for the Reed Dance Ceremony. He announced on Friday morning that he will select 3 virgins and offers them to South African President Jacob Zuma after The Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga on Wednesday announced that the class of 2016 achieved a 72.5% pass rate nationally.&#8220;This is a major improvement compared to the other years. It shows that Zuma is a hard working man and he leads by example ,the youth looks up to him, that is the reason why the managed to obtain such a good percentage. To congratulate the president for the good work he has done, I will send him 3 beautiful virgins by the end of next week.&#8221; said King Mswati III.Both leaders have similar marital policies which do not forbid them from marrying as many wives as they can. King Mswati currently has 15 wives whilst Zuma is trailing with four, having married six times. The 3 virgins will be a major improvement for him as he is working on closing the gap.&nbsp;
