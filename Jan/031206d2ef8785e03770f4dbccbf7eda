We issued thousands upon thousand of tickets to some and collected bribes when ever we could. What do you do when someone gives money to you? you take it. But I can reveal that we split the money equally among police officers, no one was robbed. Anyways, our festive operations were a success.&#8221; . the minister said.Roadblocks are expected to continue all over the country through out 2017.
