An 8 year long research conducted by The Department of Health in South Africa has revealed that it is OK to swallow. The department is dedicated to work around the clock to help South Africans live a healthy life style, it revealed on Tuesday.In the department&#8217;s latest discovery, it has been found that it is OK for women to swallow semen, if they want to be healthy and create beautiful babies.Present in semen are mood-enhancing compounds such as cortisol, estrone, oxytocin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, prolactin, melatonin and serotonin. For this reason, scientists have revealed that semen intake is very healthy, both orally and vaginally.In a study of women who engaged in oral sex and swallowed the semen, the researchers found that swallowing semen was associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia. One hypothesis for this is that substances in the semen adapt the mother s immune system so that it accepts foreign proteins present in sperm, as well as in the placenta and fetus. This maintains the blood pressure at a low level and thereby reduces the preeclampsia risk.Research has also shown that some women are infertile or miscarry due to the presence of antibodies that destroy the proteins or antigens present in their partner s semen. Having oral sex and swallowing the semen of the partner may help make the pregnancy safer and more successful as the woman is swallowing her partner&#8217;s antigens. The babies become even more beautiful the study revealed.&#8220;The study we conducted revealed that most South African women are afraid to swallow. It is OK to swallow. Don&#8217;t spit, just swallow.&#8221;Minister Motswaledi told journalist on Tuesday.Source: Online
