&#8220;Conrad Strydom from Hermanus High School in The Western Cape was South Africa&#8217;s top achiever in 2016. If it wasn&#8217;t for my muthi, Conrad was not going to get all the distinctions he got in matric&#8221;, a Pretoria sangoma revealed on Wednesday afternoon.Gogo Bathabile Nkabinde who is a famous sangoma from Pretoria revealed how Conrad and his uncle drove all the way from The Western Cape to see her in the middle of the night so he can pass his matric with flying colours.&#8220;I love education, and I&#8217;m not greedy, so I gave the muthi to him. I am glad he used it correctly and passed. I knew there was something about the boy the moment I saw him for the first time.&#8221; Said Gogo Bathabile.&#8220;I gave the boy muthi to drink, and some to put in his bathing water.Africans have believed in muthi for billions of years. I&#8217;m glad the boy has not forgotten about his roots, even though he is white. I hope more people will learn from him and come to me for muthi this year.&#8221; said Gogo Nkabinde.Conrad was unfortunately unavailable to comment.
